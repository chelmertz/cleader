cleader - CLI READER

Store web articles as plain text. No more 'saved as' HTML (aka cURL:d) or
'printed as PDF', just extracted content in markdown, without all annoying markup.


FEATURES
  Uses STDOUT, easy to process further:
    python cleader.py http://iamnearlythere.com/what_i_want_from_an_api/ | wc -c
  Save to file:
    python cleader.py --save http://iamnearlythere.com/what_i_want_from_an_api/
    creates the file 'what_i_want_from_an_interface.md'
  Extract *only* the article's HTML:
    python cleader.py http://iamnearlythere.com/what_i_want_from_an_api/ | markdown_py > what_i_want_from_an_api.html
    This example requires 'pip install markdown' and is almost what html2text
    does, but, again, cutting away all the cruft that's not the main article's content.
  Very create-your-own-library friendly, subjective example coming up:
    $ echo 'function save() { python cleader.py "$1" --save=~/favorites }' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/bashrc
    After that setup, this CLI call:
    $ save http://iamnearlythere.com/what_i_want_from_an_api/
    would create ~/favorites/what_i_want_from_an_interface.md for you
    to keep around forever and ever.
  ... which could easily be turned to a nice UNIX:y archive system:
    listing the latest 'favorites': ls -t1 ~/favorites | head -n 5
    weighted search for 'css': grep -ic css ~/favorites/* | head -n 5
    showing extracts: head -n 10 ~/favorites/* | less
